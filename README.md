# Molecular_dynamics_simulations
Simulation of molecular dynamics for different temperatures and phases. 

Here I use the Wang-Frenkel interaction potential and numerically calculate forces from it. I apply heyes thermostat to recieve different phases and calculate dimanics with Verlet integration. Visualisation is made with use of matplotlib

Used libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, tqdm
